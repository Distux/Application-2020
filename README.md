# Application-2020
Hello world!
This branch contains all my work from the past year of solidworks and autocad. 

M05 - Autocad & Solidworks
M07 - Solidoworks

My latest project  has been the assembly in M07: "1st project"
The assembly is a dragon containing 151 pieces. Screenshots of the project are located in the reference photos folder. All pices were fully defined and constrained.
